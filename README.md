# react-todo-app
A simple React todo app that runs in the browser. This project does not have any external dependencies (except React).

## Bugs:
- Switching between 'Pending tasks' and 'Completed tasks' will produce duplicated items
- Completed items will become pending on reload
- Pressing Enter at the input box cannot add the item

## Tasks:
1. Show me you can read code and produce good clean code
2. Fix the above bugs
3. Any refactoring you think will make the code better, reduce the chance to produce bugs (okay to just think of direction within time, we can discuss it later)

## Constraints
- You are not allowed to import any other external libraries
- The code must be runnable on latest Google Chrome browser
- You may refer to any online resources
- Commits should be atomic

## Evaluation
- Code cleanliness is an important marking criteria.
- Don't rush submitting your solution, take some time to refine it.
- Try to think about how user will use the app while designing your solution.
